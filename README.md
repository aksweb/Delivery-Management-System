# Delivery-Management-System
Efficiently manage your deliveries from start to finish with our streamlined system. Simplify logistics and improve customer satisfaction.

# Inspiration❤️:
The inspiration for this code could be a delivery management system for a logistics company, where the system can optimize the delivery route to minimize the time and distance travelled by delivery personnel.

# What it does?
This code uses the Nearest Neighbor and 2-Opt algorithms to optimize the delivery route, given a list of locations to be visited, and returns an array of indices that indicate the order in which to visit the locations.

# How we built it?
This code is built using JavaScript and the following libraries: **Express.js**, **geolib**. The **computeDistanceMatrix()** function computes the distance matrix between all pairs of locations using the **geolib** library. The **findNearestNeighborRoute()** function uses the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to find a preliminary route, while **optimize2Opt()** function uses the 2-Opt algorithm to improve the preliminary route. The **optimizeDeliveryRoute()** function orchestrates the whole process.

# Challenges we ran into:
One of the challenges could be that the implementation of the algorithms could have some edge cases that could affect the accuracy of the results. Additionally, handling large data sets could also be a potential challenge.

# What's next?
In an advanced version of this, one could create their own custom machine learning model to optimize the delivery route. The model could be trained on various factors such as traffic conditions, distance, delivery time, and weather, among other things. The model could be fine-tuned to minimize delivery time and distance while optimizing the overall delivery operations.
